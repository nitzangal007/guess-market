# Guess Market Project Handoff

## Mode

Implementation. Nitzan approved the seven-stage implementation plan on 2026-08-15. Stage 1 is authorized and begins test-first on the isolated `codex/e1-project-foundation` milestone branch.

## Current state

- This folder is the dedicated Guess Market repository root.
- The private repository is published at `https://github.com/nitzangal007/guess-market` with `main` as its default branch.
- The outer workspace split commit is `df4219e0406d2b0315f739b737f28d126a80d2c2`.
- The standalone root commit is `d006eaf45910d4cdc164d800d07e70d697d0eb90`.
- A fresh private clone reproduced the approved 22-file baseline with no `provided` or `private` directory and only the approved JAXB subset.
- The approved design passed its pre-implementation review with no blocking finding.
- Documentation is organized under `docs/design`, `docs/planning`, `docs/guides`, `docs/reviews`, and `docs/repository`.
- Course originals, private submission files, raw internal review evidence, build output, runtime `.ser` files, and identity-bearing archives remain untracked.
- Java source roots, build files, generated JAXB project source, IntelliJ configuration, tests, and packaging inputs do not exist yet.
- `docs/planning/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` contains the approved staged implementation plan and effort estimate.
- `docs/guides/IMPLEMENTATION-WALKTHROUGH.md` is the living method and learning record. Every entry remains `Planned` because no implementation exists.

## Authority

- Complete approved design: `docs/design/EXERCISE-1-DESIGN.md`
- Concise design entry point: `docs/design/EXERCISE-1-DESIGN-BRIEF.md`
- Repository policy: `docs/repository/GITHUB-REPOSITORY-DESIGN.md`
- Documentation map: `docs/README.md`
- Detailed implementation plan: `docs/planning/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
- Living implementation walkthrough: `docs/guides/IMPLEMENTATION-WALKTHROUGH.md`

## Fixed implementation boundaries

- Java 25
- Three modules: DTO, Engine, and UI
- UI depends on Engine and DTO; Engine depends on DTO; DTO depends only on the JDK
- JAXB/XJC remains Engine-private integration technology
- One repository-owned Windows Batch build is authoritative for compilation, testing, packaging, and verification
- Three separate non-fat application JARs
- Exact final ZIP verification includes a clean Windows run and manual grader walkthrough

## Exact next action

Create the isolated Stage 1 worktree, then execute Tasks 1 through 3 test-first. Stop after the Stage 1 regression gate and walkthrough update for Nitzan's review before Stage 2.
